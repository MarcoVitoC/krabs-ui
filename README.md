# ðŸ’° Krabs
Krabs is a full-stack trial app for simple expense tracking, built with Spring Boot and Vue.js. The `krabs-ui` frontend aims to provide users with an intuitive interface for managing their finances while allowing me to gain a solid understanding of Vue.js, state management with Pinia, and styling with TailwindCSS. It includes user authentication and simple CRUD features for managing expenses.
